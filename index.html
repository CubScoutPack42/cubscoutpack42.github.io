            <p>Hey, Patrol Parents-
  </p>
<p>Time for our boys have flown by so fast! I can remember when most of our boys were starting off as small cute little Tigers and now we are talking about "Arrow of Light" and "Webelos to Scout Transitions"!! They are growing at an expedited rate it seems like.
  </p>
<p>Please take the time to look up what "Webelos to Scout Transition" is all about at http://www.westford.com/troop195/wp-content/uploads/WebToScout.pdf  Though the document is 13 years old, it has some valuable info to help you understand what is about to take place.
  </p>
<p>Also, to help the scout & parents with the transition, we are invited to part of the Boy Scout Camporee for the "Webelos to Scout Transition Weekend" at Camp La-No-Che on December 5-7. For more information, flyer and to register...... http://cflscouting.org/division/camplanoche/webelos-to-scout-camp/
 </p>
<p>The Pack has decided to do a local Fall Campout this year. We would like to get as many of our boys signed up and it looks like it will be an awesome time! Also, please remember when you sign up online and pay for your camping the pack can reimburse you out of your childs scout account!!
